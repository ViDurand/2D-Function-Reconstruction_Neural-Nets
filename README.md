## Two dimensional function reconstruction using neural networks

This repository contains implementions of neural networks in python language for a univerty project at "La Sapienza Rome". the related course is named "Optimization Methods for Machine Learning".

## Implemented algorithms

We impleted the following algorithms:

* MLP (Multi Layer Perceptron) network with only one hidden layer.

* RBF (Radial Basis Function) network

* Two blocks methods (for both MLP and RBF)

* Decomposition method
